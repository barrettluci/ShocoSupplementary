        <h1>Oil Viscosity, Why It's Important</h1>

        <p>
            Of all the characteristics a lubricant may possess, the most important is its viscosity. The viscosity of a fluid and how that viscosity reacts to variables will determine how well a fluid can perform the basic functions of a lubricant. There is no compromise for the proper viscosity.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Viscosity?</h2>
        <p>
            When a fluid is subjected to external forces, it resists flow due to internal molecular friction. Viscosity is a measure of that internal friction. Viscosity can be referred to as the measurement of a fluid's resistance to flow. Viscosity can be viewed in two different ways. The first is a fluid's tendency to flow as it is visually seen. One can think of this as the time it takes to empty a fluid out of a container. The term for this is kinematic viscosity, and it is expressed in units suggesting flow volume over a period of time. The most commonly used unit of kinematic viscosity is centistokes (cSt). Another is Saybolt Universal Second (SUS or SSU). When comparing the viscosity of two different fluids, keep in mind that a consistent base temperature must be used for different units, and therefore they cannot be directly compared. The temperature of the fluid being tested will also affect the outcome. Kinematic viscosity of a lubricant is determined at 100째C (212째F) and/or 40째C (104째F) depending on the grading system being used. For general comparison purposes, the temperature at which the viscosity was determined for the two products must be the same.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second is a fluid's tendency to flow as indicated by measured resistance. You can think of this as the energy required to move an object through a fluid. It takes little energy to stir water with a spoon. However, significantly more energy is required to stir honey with that same spoon. The term for this is dynamic viscosity or absolute viscosity, and it is expressed in units known as centipoises (cP).
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether it is reported in centistokes, SUS, or centipoises units, the higher the number assigned, the more viscous or thicker the fluid is. And a fluid's viscosity or thickness is directly proportional to its internal friction and resistance to flow.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Viscosity is Important</h2>
        <p>
            A fluid's viscosity is important because it is directly related to its load-carrying capabilities. The greater a fluid's viscosity, the greater the loads it can withstand. The viscosity of a fluid must be adequate to separate moving parts under normal operating conditions (temperature and speed).
        </p>

        <p>
            Knowing that a fluid's viscosity is directly related to its ability to carry a load, one would think that the more viscous a fluid, the better it is. The fact is, the use of a high-viscosity fluid can be just as detrimental as using too light an oil.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Too low (thin or light) = Metal-to-metal contact (friction and wear), poor sealing, and increased oil consumption.</li>
            <li>Too high (thick or heavy) = Increased fluid friction, reduced energy efficiency, higher operating temperature, and equipment starting difficulties, particularly at cold temperatures.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The key is to select a fluid that is not too light and not too heavy.
