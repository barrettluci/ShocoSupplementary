        <h1>Managing the Risk of Mixing/Misapplication of Lubricating Oils</h1>
        <p><i>The following is a consolidation of information regarding managing risks of lubricant misapplication appearing in <strong>Machinery Lubrication</strong> (9/2001) and written by Arnold Shugarman.</i></p>

        <p>
            Most if not all high-performance lubricants are specifically formulated with a carefully selected balance of performance additives and base stocks to match the lubrication requirements of the equipment in which they are used. When lubricants are mixed, this balance is often upset. Mechanical problems leading to shorter equipment life can occur, sometimes catastrophically.
        </p>

        <p>
            Modern lubricants are sophisticated products, formulated to meet the demanding lubrication requirements of modern equipment. Mixing lubricants is fraught with danger since it can have a negative impact on your equipment, your business, and your bottom line. When in doubt, don't mix different lubricants. If it occurs accidentally, address the problem immediately. Don't be afraid to bring in an expert, whether it is the lubricant manufacturer, the additive supplier, or an independent consultant. The seriousness of the situation where different lubricants are mixed will depend on the products in the mixture, the end-use application, the relative concentrations of products, and the total volume involved.
        </p>

        <p>
            In its mildest form, mixing different lubricants may lead to a degradation of lubricant performance. Mixing the same API grades of synthetic passenger car motor oil and mineral oil-based engine oil won't damage the engine, but you will lose the performance features you expect from the synthetic. At the other end of the spectrum, adding typical turbine oil to an antiwear hydraulic oil in a high-pressure hydraulic pump could spell disaster.
        </p>

        <h2>Understanding Modern Lubricants</h2>
        <p>
            To understand why some mixed oils are OK but others are not, one must understand how modern lubricants are formulated. Most performance lubricants are a blend of base stocks and additives. The base stock is the oily portion of the lubricant, chosen for the physical and chemical properties needed in the final blend. Base stocks, in most industrial lubricants, are selected based on the requirements for viscosity, oxidation stability, fire resistance, biodegradability, and water miscibility in the final product. They carry the load in hydrodynamic lubrication, remove heat and debris from friction and wear, and help seal out contaminants.
        </p>

        <h2>Risks of Mixing Synthetic and Mineral Oils</h2>
        <p>
            Most lubricants are formulated with mineral base stocks that are severely refined, low-wax, heavy distillate fractions of crude oil. They are relatively low cost, generally good solvents for most additives, available in a wide viscosity range, and compatible with a number of seal materials. Synthetic base stocks are made by chemical manufacturers to impart special qualities to the finished oil. Examples include Polyalphaolefin (PAO), organic esters, glycols, and phosphate esters.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lubricants made with synthetic base stocks should not be mixed with products made with mineral oil, even if they are designed for the same application. The limited exceptions include some PAO and ester-based products. Even then, compatibility is often concentration-dependent. Deposits may form because of additive incompatibility, or seal compatibility may be compromised.
        </p>

        <h2>Additives and Compatibility Issues</h2>
        <p>
            Additives impart special performance features to the finished oil. The choice of additives and the balance among them differentiate an antiwear hydraulic oil from a turbine oil, for example. Some additives affect the physical properties of the finished lubricant. Others change the lubricant's chemical properties or are added for cosmetic purposes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some lubricants are incompatible because of differences in additive chemistry that lead to undesirable chemical reactions. If these oils are mixed, insoluble material may form and then deposit onto sensitive machine surfaces. For a hydraulic fluid, this could lead to lubricant starvation, valve failure, or increased wear.
        </p>

        <h2>Preventing Mixing and Misapplication</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Clearly label all containers.</li>
            <li>Check manifests on oil shipments against delivered products.</li>
            <li>Supervise the unloading of bulk oil.</li>
            <li>Segregate oils that are known to be incompatible.</li>
            <li>Avoid using common hoses, funnels, and containers to transfer lubricants from different families.</li>
            <li>Obtain assurance from suppliers about the compatibility of new or improved products.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps to Handle Mixed Oils</h2>
        <p>
            When an oil mixing problem occurs, certain prudent steps should be followed:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Empty the tank before adding new products.</li>
            <li>Isolate the system and drain the oil.</li>
            <li>Document the identity, volume, and intended use of each lubricant.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Before mixing lubricants or using lubricants that have been mixed, check with the oil manufacturer for the best course of action. Most importantly, look for ways to avoid the situation in the first place.
