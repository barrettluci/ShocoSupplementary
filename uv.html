        <h1>Effects of UV Light on PE Intermediate Bulk Containers (Totes)</h1>

        <p>
            Most Intermediate Bulk containers on the market today are manufactured from Polyethylene (PE). They are made to contain a variety of liquid products including Lubrication Oils. All polyethylene (PE) is susceptible to degradation upon long-term exposure to sunlight. This degradation is brought about by physical changes, which occur in the polyethylene as a result of exposure to the ultraviolet (UV) portion of sunlight. UV light contains shorter wavelengths than visible light. The shorter the wave length, the more energy it contains and thus, the more damage it does. UV light alters the physical characteristics of polyethylene (PE). It does this by breaking the carbon and hydrogen bonds, creating free radicals, which, in turn, break the PE into shorter molecules and thus, a more brittle polymer. Effectively, UV light creates a higher melt index polyethylene, especially on the exposed surface area. This shows up as a reduction in break elongation and impact properties, typical of higher melt index PE. The subsequent attachment of oxygen to these broken sites leads to further accelerated degradation and the formation of oxidized species such as carbonyl and car-boxyl structures, which are often used as analytical indicators of UV degradation.

        <h2>Leaching Effects</h2>
        <p>
            There have been a few studies done exploring the “leaching” of chemicals from plastic containers into the liquid that the container holds. These studies focus on plastic water bottles which in recent years has become the most convenient water source. In some places these bottles are sold and stored in direct sunlight. Through personal experience one may notice that a bottle of water left in a hot car for a few hours on a hot, sunny day will produce water with a strange taste. This taste is actually caused by a chemical called acetaldehyde, which is the same substance that the body metabolizes ethanol into and causes hangovers. This chemical is formed as a result of UV photo-degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PETE #1 plastic, used for two liter soda and disposable water bottles). (<i>Analysis of Chemical Leaching from Common Consumer Plastic Bottles Under High Stress Conditions</i>, Paul John Dornath, Oregon State University, University Honors College) It is not known if similar studies have been done on Intermediate Bulk Containers or if any potential leached material is harmful to petroleum lubricating oils.

        <h2>Photochemical Effects</h2>
        <p>
            All types of UV can cause a photochemical effect within the polymer structure, which can lead to degradation of some sort to the material. The higher energy UVC is the type most likely to affect plastics. Absorbed UV energy can excite the photons in a plastic. Exciting the photons can create free radicals. While many pure plastics cannot absorb UV radiation, the presence of catalyst residues and other impurities (examples: oxygen, sodium) even at trace amounts, will often act as free radical receptors. Those free radicals can cause breaks in the polymer bonds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many natural and synthetic polymers are attacked by ultraviolet radiation, and products using these materials may crack or disintegrate if they are not UV-stable. The problem is known as UV degradation, and is a common problem in products exposed to sunlight. Continuous exposure is a more serious problem than intermittent exposure, since attack is dependent on the extent and degree of exposure.
        </p>

        <h2>Degradation Observations</h2>
        <p>
            Extended exposure to sunlight can cause oil to suffer accelerated oxidation and may lead to shortened drain intervals. On a molecular level, the long chain lubricant hydrocarbon reacts with oxygen in the presence of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. As a result, it forms chromophores - conjugated aldehydes, ketones and esters. These absorb visible light to appear yellow at low concentrations and brown at higher concentrations after extended exposure to sunlight. To avoid this situation, one should protect the exposed oil from the ultraviolet energy in direct sunlight.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Ultraviolet light can damage lubricants in a short period of time. The first sign of damage in this study was the oxidation resistance of the oil. This may seem all right if the system is a once-through drip lubricant where there is no need for high levels of oxidation stability. However, if the oil feed system is used as a constant leveler for a small reservoir, one may be adding bad oil to good oil! (<i>Machinery Lubrication</i>)
